Data-visualization exercise with Python and RESTful API 

Hello! This is a project designed to improve my data visualization and analysis skills 
with Python and in the proccess hopefully we can become rich!!!!

Here is a quick breakdown

To use simply download the virtual environment ~ coinenv and in the command line run:"python automated_plot.py"
A graph will display showing price and updates periodically (* note you need your own api key I don't want to give you mine)

see included screen shot for data visualization example 

How it works 

1 - I make an API call to retrive pricing data
2 - Create an array and filter data how I see fit with NumPy and Pandas
3 - Calculate a regression, or line of best fit
4 - Add two more regression lines + and - one standard deviation to identify
buying / selling points
5 - Display the data visually with Matplot
